# Our Slot:

Our slot was from 7-7:30, but I got plenty of time to look before and after at other projects from all different classes, not just ourselves. I had great fun talking to various parents who were interested in our project

# Our Project (& who came to see it)

Our project was a robot that, while the socket didn't exactly work, the robot could move. This was a huge selling point, because this was something that had almost never been seen or done in a CS class. This was a great experience, and I love presenting about different facets. We talked to many parents, some who asked about the specifics of our project, those who were interested in how our project works, and some who talked about their own projects with worker.
