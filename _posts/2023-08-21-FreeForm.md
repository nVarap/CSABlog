# My Freeform

## What does my freeform mean?

- My freeform talks about my wants in the form of my legacy. I often consider what my action will do to affect my legacy and my image to others, and so that text represents that
- It also represents the only state I have lived in, California, and the movement from The Bay Area to San Diego.
- It also represents three main things I hold: Music, Family, and Fun
  - I always seek to be with family (or friends) who I can support and support me
  - I love listening to music and do hope to create it as a passion project, but music calms me and fills me with the right emotions
  - I always try to have fun in whatever I do. I am often a worker who needs to be motivated to do tasks, as I aim to always have fun.
