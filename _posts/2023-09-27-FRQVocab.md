# FRQ 1
- Methods - Functions that perform actions in clsses
- Nested if statements - An if statement within an if statemnt, allows for furhter selection
- For loops - A loop to loops over a condition, typically an iterative
- Booleans - A primitive data type that can only hold two values, 1 and 0
- Primitive data types - Data types that can be stored using one location in memory
- Random.random - Gives a random number

# FRQ 2
- `super`  - A keyword that is used to call the constructor of a parent class
- `@override` and other annotators - Used to modify functions, typically that of a child function 
- Local and global scope - Different scopes, or localities in which variables can be used. Local is within a block, global everywhere.
- Constructors - A special method that when called creates an object
- Setters and getters - Methods that are used to set and get values of an instance


# FRQ 3
- Lists  - A java extra data class that is an iterative
- ArrayLists - A java reference class that allows for greater functionality with java arrays
- Primitive data types - See above
- iteration - Being able to iterate over certain iterables in Java. Done with a for and while loop
- ArrayList Methods - `.get`,  `.set`, `.add`, etc.

# FRQ 4
- 2D arrays - Nested arrays
- Iteration - See above
- Selection - Selecting certain values while iterating
- Indexing - Going and looking throughout values in an iterable
- Operators - Symbols used for code calculations
- Boolean - See above
- Nested Arrays - Arrays within arrays, in python, a list of a list. 
- nested for loops - A for loop within a for loop, typically related to the iteration of 2d arrays
- Break - Leaving the bounds of a loop without completing, often on a certain condition
