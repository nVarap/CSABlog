**Methods:**

1. **Defining Methods:**
   - Syntax for method declaration.
   - Access modifiers (public, private, protected).
   - Return types and void methods.

2. **Method Overloading:**
   - Overloading methods with different parameter lists.
   - Rules for determining the signature of an overloaded method.

3. **Recursion:**
   - Basics of recursive methods.
   - Base case and recursive case.
   - The concept of a stack in recursion.

4. **Scope and Lifetime:**
   - Local variables vs. instance variables.
   - Understanding block scope.
   - Lifetime of variables.

5. **Static Methods and Variables:**
   - Declaring and using static methods.
   - Static variables and their role.

**Data Structures:**

1. **Arrays:**
   - Declaration and initialization of arrays.
   - Accessing elements and array length.
   - Common array operations.

2. **Lists:**
   - ArrayList vs. LinkedList.
   - Adding, removing, and accessing elements in lists.
   - Iterating through lists.

3. **Stacks and Queues:**
   - Implementation and applications.
   - LIFO (Last In, First Out) for stacks.
   - FIFO (First In, First Out) for queues.

4. **Trees:**
   - Binary trees and binary search trees (BST).
   - Tree traversal (in-order, pre-order, post-order).
   - Balancing trees and AVL trees.

5. **Graphs:**
   - Basics of graphs and their representation.
   - Depth-First Search (DFS) and Breadth-First Search (BFS).
   - Graph algorithms like Dijkstra's and Prim's.

6. **Hashing:**
   - Hash functions and collision resolution.
   - Hash tables and their implementation.
   - Understanding time complexity in hash-based operations.

7. **Sorting and Searching:**
   - Common sorting algorithms (Bubble Sort, Quick Sort, Merge Sort).
   - Binary search and linear search.

8. **Complexity Analysis:**
   - Big O notation and time complexity.
   - Analyzing the efficiency of algorithms.

Remember, these are broad topics, and there may be specific details or variations based on the programming language you're using. Additionally, practice with coding exercises and projects is crucial for a deeper understanding of these concepts.
