# Not Code Monkeys
## FRQ 4:
a. Iterated through array to get certain values
b. Tests where it is a latin square or not wheter it is allowed to do certain things
c. First he also created the next necessary has all or create duplicates
d. Used this to find the latin squares and the isLatin method.
e. tested in the columns and in the column
- It will test whether the array is a latin square or not then
  
uses strings to then test.

## FRQ 4 (again)
- Had to work with a lightboard
- had to build the general constructor
- and iterate through the lightboard in order to increment through the array
- then generate a random new integer. 
- Then used a for loop to complete in linear time

## FRQ 2: Methods and classes
- Create a step tracker classes
- Check to see the number of steps over an amount

## FRQ 1: Methods and Control Systems
- Talks about the number of leap years
- This then increases the number of years in an area


## FRQ 3: Arraylists
- Wanted you to iterate through all of the token string
- Created the token string and look at the d-limiters


# Code Monkeys
## FRQ 1: Method and Control Structures
- Used nested if statements
- build a getScore() method
- playManyTimes() method in order to iterate a number of times and return the highest score
- Made some extra functions to assist with printing.
- Nested if state

## FRQ 2: Classes (me)

## FRQ 3: ArrayLists
- You can lose points for local variables and whether arraylists are bad
- You cannot use a void method that returns a value (i.e basic java)
- Collegeboard gives a public class for reviews
- Didn't provide the runtime
- Added the sum of the ratings divided by all the array (finding the mean)
- Will check to see if there is an exclamation point. 
- Could have written the 

## FRQ: Classes
- He presented late
- Wrote a guessing game
- Wrote the getInt() function
- Wanted to point out the corresponding letters.
