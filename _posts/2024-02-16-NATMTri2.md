# 2 Trimester Feedback

We used Night at the Museum in order to gain a lot of info into what people want with our project, how people want to use our application, and gathered some test data that we can use in future projects. Crowd sourcing is a huge part of our project, so its very good we used this opportunity to get people to create data.

Aside from just collecting data by asking people, we collected a lot feedback through our curated feedback [form](https://forms.gle/5gqnPYZEcdJwErfo7) that I plan to send to a lot more than 7 people in order to gather more feeback over break. However, here are the specs, sourced from the google form:

# Scale-Based Questions

## Ease of Use (average 4.7):

This graph shows that our project is intuitive and very easy to understand. Obviously, we'd like this to average out to be 5, since everyone understanding what our project is immediately would be great. Regardless, this is still a good starting point and we can definitely improve from here

## Likeliness (average 4):

Likeliness to use is a great factor to test the waters and see if our business is actually applicable on the market. It overall is a great metric to see how appealing our project is over all. That being said, this is our lowest of the three scaled question. We plan to make this a more alluring product, and are looking as a group into ways to make sure our project is alluring to high schoolers, our primary consumers.

## User Friendliness (average: 4.4):

This question checks whether our user friendliness and how at a first look our user sees how they'd like to use our product. This is a good measure of whether people really find our product easy to use, and starting out with a 4.4 is actually very cool and generally well liked! That's very good, because we plan to commit ot this frontend idea, and if it weren't it wouldn't be the best.

## Sentiment Analysis of FRQs

We asked three FRQs, and did a general sentiment analysis on each (using GPT 3.5)

## 1. What would you add to the project if you could?

For the actual meat of the question, a lot of people considered adding a groups feature (which we had already planned to do, which is really cool) or the current stock price (something we are also thinking of adding but is a stretch goal). Thus, we are seeing generally the same wavelength between us and our audience. While it is unfortunate we could not get any new ideas, it is good that we can effectively predict what our audience wants.

**Sentiment: generally positive, with some suggestions/concerns**

## 2. How does the investment page look? How easy is its functionality to understand

Overall, people really liked the investment page and its functionality. it seemed easy to understand, especially relative to the rest of the project. People commented on its ease of understanding and that it isn't overcrowded, which is a great buff.

**Sentiment: Very positive**

## 3. What is your general feedback about the project? Please be brutally honest

People generally liked the project, commenting on how they could see it grow and actually do a lot for high schoolers. It was very simplistic, which people liked. However, noting its simplicity, I felt that this means we have room to add a lot more, including more in-depth company management, promotion, etc. 

**Sentiment: Very positive**
