# Reflection: 



# Incorrect Questions

## Number 21: finCloset Method

**Why I got it wrong**
I got this wrong because to find the value that is closet to val, the algorithm needs to calculate the positive difference between num and val. This selection did not result in that. Instead, I should have seen D, where you set the difference being less than the number minus the value. <mark>Correct Answer: D</mark>

## Number 23: Animals List

**Why I got it wrong**
I got his wrong because the List is an interface, which an ArrayList implements. Please note that List is no longer tested as part of the AP CSA exam and ArrayList will be used instead. This would be the correct answer if the remove occurred before the size was calculated in the statement animals.add(animals.size()-k, animals.remove(k)); and only one iteration of the loop occurred. Instead, even though List is no longer tested, I should have seen no changes would have been made and selected accordingly. <mark>Correct Answer: B</mark>
