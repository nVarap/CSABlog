# Reflection: 
I recently tackled a set of College Board multiple-choice questions, and overall, I am quite satisfied with my performance. I looked up certain things, such as recursion and as iteration help. My weakest points were definitely inheritance and recursion

Of the entire set, I only got two questions wrong, and what stings is that these questions were, in all honesty, quite easy. They dealt with topics I should have had down pat: lists and methods. The frustration stems from the fact that I know I possess the knowledge and skills to excel in these areas, and yet, I let a momentary lapse in concentration lead to those two incorrect answers.

Moving forward, I'll use this experience as motivation to be even more meticulous in my approach to future assessments. I know that I'm more than capable of acing questions related to lists and methods, and I won't allow these minor setbacks to deter my progress. Instead, I'll take them as opportunities for growth and improvement, ensuring that I sharpen my skills further and avoid such mistakes in the future.

In conclusion, while I'm overall satisfied with my performance on the College Board multiple-choice questions, the two questions I missed related to lists and methods have left me feeling slightly miffed at myself. This experience serves as a reminder that no question is too easy to be taken lightly, and I'll use it as a catalyst for even greater attention to detail and a commitment to avoiding similar errors in the future.

# Incorrect Questions

## Number 21: findCloset Method

**Why I got it wrong**
I got this wrong because to find the value that is closet to val, the algorithm needs to calculate the positive difference between num and val. This selection did not result in that. Instead, I should have seen D, where you set the difference being less than the number minus the value. <mark>Correct Answer: D</mark>

## Number 23: Animals List

**Why I got it wrong**
I got his wrong because the List is an interface, which an ArrayList implements. Please note that List is no longer tested as part of the AP CSA exam and ArrayList will be used instead. This would be the correct answer if the remove occurred before the size was calculated in the statement animals.add(animals.size()-k, animals.remove(k)); and only one iteration of the loop occurred. Instead, even though List is no longer tested, I should have seen no changes would have been made and selected accordingly. <mark>Correct Answer: B</mark>
