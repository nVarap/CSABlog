# Reflection: 
Scoring a 91% on my recent computer science assignment was certainly a satisfying achievement. It was a moment of validation for the effort and dedication I've put into mastering the subject. While the grade reflects a solid understanding of the material and the ability to implement the core concepts effectively, it also serves as a reminder of the areas where improvement is needed.

One of the most striking aspects of this assignment was that I didn't feel overwhelmed or struggle throughout the process. This is a testament to the consistent effort I've invested in studying computer science, building a strong foundation, and developing problem-solving skills over time. It's a gratifying feeling to see that my hard work is paying off, and my understanding of the subject is becoming more robust.

# To Work On: 
1. Depth Research: I'll take the time to delve deeper into the subject matter before I begin working on the assignment. This will allow me to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the problem and its nuances, which in turn will enable me to address all facets effectively.
2. Thorough Planning: I intend to improve my project planning by breaking the assignment into smaller, manageable tasks. This way, I can ensure that no crucial aspect is overlooked, and I have a clear roadmap to guide me through the project.
3. Testing and Debugging: I'll allocate more time for thorough testing and debugging. This step is often underestimated, but it's vital to catch any potential issues and ensure the project's completeness.
4. Peer Feedback: Seeking feedback from peers or mentors can be invaluable. They may point out areas I might have missed or offer insights that can help me improve the overall quality of my work.
5. Time Management: I'll work on my time management skills to make sure I have ample time to address all aspects of the assignment. Procrastination can be a significant hindrance to achieving completeness.
