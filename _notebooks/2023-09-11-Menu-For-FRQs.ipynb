For example, with the FRQ I just did, in part a, I had to create a method for getScore, which returned the score of the user. If the game that the user played was a bonus round, their total score would be multiplied by 3. For part b, I had to write the code for the playManyTimes method, which returned the highest score of the games played if the play() method was called more than once.</body></html>\");\n",

When you approach this specific problem, you primarily have to write a large amount of code by yourself, and know some of the intricacies of writing classes. Unlike most of the FRQs, this is not very fill-in-the-blank. Thus, when approaching this frq, it is necessary for students to be aware of how methods work, and how to approach certain ideas of classes.</body></html>\");\n",

Just like the example you mentioned, part (a) might require you to create a method, such as getScore, with a specific purpose. For instance, it could involve calculating and returning a user's score, taking into account bonus rounds that might triple their total score. In part (b) of the question, you could be asked to implement a method like playManyTimes. This method might be designed to analyze multiple game rounds, and your task would be to return the highest score achieved among these rounds if the play() method is called more than once. Overall, the ArrayList FRQ evaluates your ability to work with dynamic data structures, such as ArrayLists, in Java. Your goal is to write code that accomplishes well-defined objectives, including handling potential complexities and variations in the problem.</body></html>\");\n",

It also asks the students to write program code to satisfy method specifications using expressions, conditional statements, and iterative statements. CollegeBoard provides the student with a ReviewAnalysis class, and I had to write code for two methods inside said class. In part A, I had to write code for a loop that accessed each element of the array instance variable allReviews and returned the calculated average of all the return values of the method getRating. I had to declare and initialize a variable to hold the sum of all ratings. Inside the loop, I had to call the method getRating on all Review elements in allReviews, accumulating a total of the ratings.
